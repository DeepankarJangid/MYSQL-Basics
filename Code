-- The first step in the SQL is to create a Database. 
-- So the syntax to create a Database is 
Create Database database_name;
-- Querrry:
Create Database Admin;

-- This a Query to create a table. But to store that table inn the Admin Database we have to write a querry
USE Admin;
-- This is a Query to create table. the Table name is Stores. 
CREATE TABLE Stores (
	store_id int ,
	store_name VARCHAR (255),
	phone int ,
	email VARCHAR (255),
	street VARCHAR (255),
	city VARCHAR (255),
	state VARCHAR (10),
	zip_code VARCHAR (6)
);

Select * from Stores ;
alter table Stores 
DROP column zip_code ;

-- The Next step is to insert the values in to the table .
-- So to insert the Values we will use "Insert" Command.

Insert Into Stores Values 
('1', 'Wing11', 'wing11.1@org.in', 'Mumbai')
('2', 'Wing11', 'wing11.2@org.in', 'Delhi')
('3', 'wing11', 'wing11.3@org.in', 'Kolkata')
('4', 'wing11', 'wing11.4@org.in', 'Chennai')
('5', 'wing11', 'wing11.5@org.in', 'Hydrabad') ;

-- The Next step is to now fetch the data from the Table which we created.
-- The Command for fetching the data from the table is "Select" and * is used to select all the values in the table. 
Select City from Stores ;

-- Now in this querry we will use the "WHERE" clause. The WHERE clause is used to filter any data base on a condition.
Select * from Stores
Where city = 'Delhi' ;

-- Now we are going to use the "DISTINCT" Operator.
-- This is a type of operator which fetch the unique record from the duplicate data present in the table.
Select DISTINCT store_id from Stores;
-- This command is to delete thhe complete table what we have created.
Drop table Stores;
